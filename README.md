Thoughts about how to learn and teach reading and writing!

Reading and writing are about transcribing sounds of speech.

Irish English has about 45 contrasting speech sounds (phonemes).
* The best way to represent these phonemes is with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
* Learning the IPA also works for representing the sounds of Irish or any other language!

English orthography does represent the sounds of our speech, though with some caveats...
* Starting off at the 'Pirate Pat' level where "p" is always /p/ and "a" is always /a/ and "t" is always /t/ is great. Davy and Cormac both found this totally intuitive.
* But beyond that, English spelling often works at the level of *groups of letters* representing sounds rather than single letters (e.g. "that", "pour", "fire")
  * :nerd_face: **Drawing boxes around letter groups, and writing down the corresponding IPA symbol, was really helpful for Davy and especially Cormac!**
* And one letter combination can map to several sounds (e.g. "row", "row"), and one sound can be represented by several letter combinations (e.g. "night", "bite", "biology")

So there's a medium but finite number of sound-spelling combinations - about 200.

* Obviously that's way more than 26, but it is a manageable amount of stuff to learn.
* It's much better to acknowledge the size of the task rather than to pretend that there's just this once-off 'learn the alphabet' job but then an uncharted ocean of 'English spelling is weird'!
  * :nerd_face: **Build up different ways to spell sounds on walls of classroom over the course of a school year - grouped by IPA symbol. What patterns are there in how different spellings are used to correspond to various sounds?**

And! There are patterns to the weirdness.
* There are different spelling patterns for words that come from Old English/Old Norse, from French, from Latin and Greek, and from other recent borrowings.
* Being able to recognise these patterns is incredibly useful.
* It goes along with learning about the history of words (etymology)
  * Wiktionary is an amazing resource for this!!!
* ...and knowing how to break up words into 'word chunks' (morphology).

And! The way words keep their history in their spelling allows you to be a language detective - an archaeologist of words - in a way that's much harder with totally phonetic writing systems - e.g. Italian or Spanish or even Irish.
* This is a real plus point of the weird English spelling system.
* You can work out - a lot of the time - both what language a word came into English from, and also reconstruct how a word would have been pronounced in the 'Knights and Castles' time.
  * :nerd_face: **Talk like a /knixt/ in a /kastel/ activity**
  * :nerd_face: **Songs from Middle Ages - e.g. Sumer is icumen in (it even has farting in it!!)**
    
The further you get into this, the richer it is.
* [The History of English podcast] (https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/) is such a great friendly resource for telling this story! 
* English words can come from anywhere in the world as borrowings -
  * Learn about discovery of New World and at the same time about range of food words that come from e.g. Aztec Nahuatl langauge ('tomato', 'avocado', 'chilli', 'chocolate'...)
  * Learn about Islamic world and at the same time about all the words that came from there in the Middle Ages - sciencey ones like 'alcohol', 'alkali', 'algorithm', 'zero'; food ones like 'orange', 'saffron', 'spinach', 'sorbet'/'sherbet'...
  * ...and at the same time trace those words back further to their origins - e.g. 'orange' came from a Dravidian language in India then through Persian into Arabic
    * :nerd_face: **A group can present everything about a word to class!**
* ...but most English words are Indo-European, either directly from Old English / Germanic, or via Italic (Latin or French < Latin), or via Greek. There is so much awesomeness to be discovered about all the hidden relationships between English words once you drop down to Indo-European!! 
    * :nerd_face: **Dinosaur/archosaur names: e.g. "pter" in "pterodactyl" is same PIE root that gives "feather" in English and "eitleÃ¡n" in Irish ðŸ™‚**
* Can learn history not just of languages themselves, but of writing systems used to write them - e.g. the alphabet, and of how it's been used in different places at different times (e.g. Irish was written using a version of Latin where letter 'c' still always represented a /k/ sound)

Learning all of this is incredibly empowering for anyone - child or adult. The feeling of finding patterns and being a detective is such a great one!
* There are all these tips about memory training - making up things where you imagine stories to help you remember a new word or whatever - but the real web of history and interrelationships between words is a vastly richer framework for weaving memories!

Phonetics and Phonology
* Phonetics is the actual sounds that people make when speaking (or hear when others are speaking). 
* Phonology is the way our brains organise this stream of sounds into individual units called phonemes that we perceive as different from each other - /bad/ vs /bat/ vs /pat/ vs /pit/ and so on.
* The International Phonetic Alphabet is *the* tool for recording speech sounds - both full-on phonetics, with every detail spelled out, and simpler phonological transcription. 
  * It's very like transcribing music - you can write down very exact rhythms, dynamics, harmonies, or you can just write a tune with some chord indications.
  * It's this simpler phonological use of the IPA that's really useful for learning reading/writing. 
  * IPA is used in lots of places - e.g. Wikipedia (you wouldn't have to ask how Eostra was pronounced...!!) - singing, acting...
  * It's not hard to learn - the consonants especially are very intuitive.
  * Of course you can learn to read and write - or to teach reading and writing - without the IPA - just as you can learn to be a great musician without knowing how to read music beyond chord charts.
* Big question though:
  * What are the sounds of Irish English?
  * OED has this set of sounds - consonants perfect but to me vowels are too much 'OR TEE EE' / Ross O'Carroll Kelly sounding 
  * I made a careful list that's in little filofax that Davy and I worked on together.
	* :nerd_face: **It would be really good for teachers in school to work together to agree on the standard set of sounds that are being taught as 'English' - this is also a brilliant way to learn IPA especially vowels.**
* And standard Irish is actually easier! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Irish
